## Introduction

I have selected this data set because I am interested in learning about which properties have a significant impact on the quality of a wine. Specifically, I have begun researching the world of wines recently and this variety comes from the north of Portugal. As a descendent of two Portuguese immigrants, I thought it would be a great data set to work with.

## Data

Data source: 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality 

Data collection: 
This data set is a collection of wine data sampled from the northern end of Portugal by Paulo Cortez in 2009. Specifically, it comes from a variety of grapes called "Vinho Verde". Cortez collected these samples "to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests." 

Units of observations: 
The column names are denoted below with a brief summary describing the unit of observation.

1. fixed acidity        - Ratio (double), 4 Types of acids found in wine.

2. volatile acidity     - Ratio (double), Measure of a wines gaseous acid content.

3. citric acid          - Ratio (double), Measure of wines citric acid content.

4. residual sugar       - Ratio (double), Measure of natural grape sugar leftovers after fermentation.

5. chlorides            - Interval (double), Measures the saltiness of a wine. Consistent with the salt in water used during the wine making process.

6. free sulfur dioxide  - Ratio (integer), Helps with bacterial stability, should be used early before fermentation process. (free refers to remaining sulphates to fight bacteria)

7. total sulfur dioxide - Ratio (integer), A total of free sulfur dioxide plus the other portions of SO2 already present in the wine. (total refers to all sulphates present)

8. density              - Ratio (double), A Measure of how dense the wine is.

9. pH                   - Interval (double), A measure of how acidic or basic the water is. x < 7 = acidic, x > 7 = basic. 

10. sulfates            - Ratio (double), The sulfate content of the wine.

11. alcohol             - Ratio (double), The alcohol content of the wine.

12. quality             - Ordinal (integer), The overall quality of the wine evaluated by 3 wine experts.

Later additional columns will be added to each data set consisting of the following descriptions:

13. total.free          - Ratio (double), total sulfur dioxide - free sulfer dioxide.

XX. color               - Nominal (string), color of observed wine. *Only found in the aggregate wine data set.

Variables:
I plan to study the wine data set by using all of the variables given. Although, I will need to clean up certain aspects of the data set.


## Questions

Important Concepts: Wines are made in a process composed of many parts over potentially very long time periods. They have diminishing returns in each attribute column. e.g. drinking pure sulfates would be toxic not tasty. Additionally, quality is a subjective measure, even by professionals. 

1. Does the color of a wine effect the overall rated quality of a wine? This can be determined by developing analysis of the expected score of a wine for each wine set and then attempting to compare the outcomes for identical wine values. 

2. Is there a strong correlation between total/free sulfur and the quality of a wine? This can be done by deriving additional sulfate information and determine if it is correlated with quality. 

3. Is acidity an important factor in the over all quality of a wine, and if so, does the type of acidity have a significant impact? We can attempt to solve this by breaking down which types of acids are contributing more to the quality of a good wine.

4. Is the quality of a wine even valid to begin with? (Not sure how I would go about researching this.)

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Data Preprocessing

Loading and formatting data.

```{r}
redWine <- read.csv(url("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv"), sep=";")
whiteWine <- read.csv(url("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv"), sep=";")
```

Adding derived columns and creating a new aggregated data set. The new column being created describes the current "dead" sulfates that are no longer actively fighting bacterial growth.

```{r}
redWine$total.free <- (redWine$total.sulfur.dioxide - redWine$free.sulfur.dioxide)

whiteWine$total.free <- (whiteWine$total.sulfur.dioxide - whiteWine$free.sulfur.dioxide)

redWine$color <- ("Red")

whiteWine$color <- ("White")

Wine <- rbind(redWine, whiteWine)

redWine <- redWine %>% select(-color)
whiteWine <- whiteWine %>% select(-color)
```

# Data cleanup: 

```{r}
redNA <- sum(is.na(redWine))
sprintf("Missing Values of Red Wine: %d", redNA)
whiteNA <- sum(is.na(whiteWine))
sprintf("Missing Values of White Wine: %d", whiteNA)
```

I am removing the density column as each density variable is arbitrarily close to every other and I do not expect it to have a significant impact on the quality.

```{r, results='hide'}
redWine <- redWine %>% select(-density)
whiteWine <- whiteWine %>% select(-density)
Wine <- Wine %>% select(-density)
```

Standardization of improper data.

```{r, results='hide'}
redWine$alcohol <- round(redWine$alcohol, digits = 1)
redWine$residual.sugar <- round(redWine$residual.sugar, digits = 1)
redWine$free.sulfur.dioxide <- round(redWine$free.sulfur.dioxide, digits = 0)
redWine$total.sulfur.dioxide <- round(redWine$total.sulfur.dioxide, digits = 0)

whiteWine$alcohol <- round(whiteWine$volatile.acidity, digits = 2)
whiteWine$residual.sugar <- round(whiteWine$residual.sugar, digits = 1)
whiteWine$free.sulfur.dioxide <- round(whiteWine$free.sulfur.dioxide, digits = 0)
whiteWine$total.sulfur.dioxide <- round(whiteWine$total.sulfur.dioxide, digits = 0)
```

I have temporarily removed some columns to display the box plot summary in a more appealing fashion. Without such adjustments an aggregated boxplot would be practically unreadable.

```{r}
tempRed <- redWine %>% select(-total.sulfur.dioxide, -free.sulfur.dioxide, -residual.sugar, -total.free)
tempWhite <- whiteWine %>% select(-total.sulfur.dioxide, -free.sulfur.dioxide, -residual.sugar, -total.free)

par(mar=c(3,7,2,2))

boxplot(tempRed, main = "Adjusted Red Wine", outline=FALSE, names=c("fixed acidity","volatile acidity"," citric acid", "chlorides", "pH", "sulphates", "alcohol", "quality"), horizontal=TRUE, las = 2)
boxplot(tempWhite, main = "Adjusted White Wine", outline=FALSE, names=c("fixed acidity","volatile acidity"," citric acid", "chlorides", "pH", "sulphates", "alcohol", "quality"), horizontal=TRUE, las = 2)

rm("tempRed", "tempWhite", "redNA", "whiteNA") #Removing temporary Variables
```


```{r}
IsOutlier <- function(data) {
   lowerq = quantile(data)[2]
   upperq = quantile(data)[4]
   iqr = upperq - lowerq 
   threshold_upper = (iqr * 1.5) + upperq
   threshold_lower = lowerq - (iqr * 1.5)
   data > threshold_upper | data <  threshold_lower 
}
```


```{r}
redWineOutliers = redWine[rowSums(sapply(redWine, IsOutlier)) > 0, ]
whiteWineOutliers = whiteWine[rowSums(sapply(whiteWine, IsOutlier)) > 0, ]

redWine <- redWine[-c(1080, 1082),] #Cleaning Total.Sulfur
whiteWine <- whiteWine[-c(1418, 2128, 4746, 1932, 3051),] #Cleaning specific outliers that are excessively out of range in relation to the rest.
Wine <- Wine[-c(3017, 3531, 4650, 3727, 6345, 1925),]

#count(redWineOutliers)   # 416  (count turns it to a column header, not int, so I extract the number myself)
#count(whiteWineOutliers) # 1278

sprintf("Number of Outliers In Red Wine Data: 416")
sprintf("Number of Outliers In White Wine Data: 1278")
```

As it turns out, there are a significant amount of outliers throughout both data sets. As a result I removed only the most eggregious outliers.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Here I present a summary of each respective data set. These have meaningful statistics regarding the analysis of the data columns.

```{r}
summary(redWine) #Red Wine Data
```

```{r}
summary(whiteWine) #White Wine Data
```

```{r}
summary(Wine) #Aggregate Wine Data
```

The following graphic will provide us with an understanding of the distribution of wine quality given the type of wine. It is also important to remember that white wine contains approximately 3x as many variables as red wine. 

```{r}
ggplot(Wine, aes(x = quality, fill = color)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Quality by Wine Type") +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.2, position = "identity",  binwidth = 1)
```

One question that could be asked is why are there differences in the quality distribution between both data sets? One proposal is that the variety of grapes being used, along with other external factors, may contribute to a better white wine than a similar red wine.

# Question 1
Color and Quality

1. Does the color of a wine effect the overall rated quality of a wine? This can be determined by developing analysis of the expected score of a wine for each wine set and then attempting to compare the outcomes for identical wine values. 

# Question 3
Sulfates and Quality

```{r}
ggplot(Wine, aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, y = total.sulfur.dioxide)) +
   theme_dark() + 
   geom_point(aes(color = quality)) + 
   labs(title = "Total vs Free Sulfur Quality") +
   stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level.., alpha = ..level..), geom = 'polygon', color = "black", countour_var = "quality",  show.legend = FALSE) +
   geom_smooth(data = redWine, method = lm, se = FALSE, col = "red") +
   geom_smooth(data = whiteWine, method = lm, se = FALSE, col = "white")
```

As demonstrated in the graph above there is an interesting relationship between the sulfur contents and quality. There is a "sweet spot", around (10,10) and (30, 110), these tend to demonstrate a higher quality wine. This appears when we can see a balance between total and free sulfur. Outside of this sweet spot, quality varies widely. As total sulfur dioxide increases we tend to see lower quality wines. This was unexpected, but makes sense as too much sulfur can mean a wine does not grow, while too little sulfur may indicate too much growth. Here my reference to growth entails that the wine continues to evolve flavors while in the bottle. 


```{r}
ggplot(Wine, aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide, y = total.sulfur.dioxide) ) +
   labs(title = "Total to Free Sulfur Density") +
   stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..density..), geom = "raster", contour = FALSE)  +
   geom_smooth(data = redWine, method = lm, se = FALSE, aes(col = "red")) +
   geom_smooth(data = whiteWine, method = lm, se = FALSE, aes(col = "white"))+
   scale_colour_manual(name = "Avg. Line Per Wine", values = c("Red", "White"), labels = c("Red Wine", "White Wine"))
```

The graph above demonstrates the density of the wine data points given total and free sulfur.

```{r}
plot(redWine$total.sulfur.dioxide, redWine$quality, col = 'red', pch = 19, cex = .5, xlab = 'Total Sulfur', ylab = 'Quality', main = 'Red Wine Quality to Total Sulfur')

plot(whiteWine$total.sulfur.dioxide, whiteWine$quality, col = 'Blue', pch = 19, cex = .5, xlab = 'Total Sulfur', ylab = 'Quality', main = 'White Wine Quality to Total Sulfur')
```

```{r}
plot(redWine$free.sulfur.dioxide, redWine$quality, col = 'Red', pch = 19, cex = .5, xlab = 'Free Sulfur', ylab = 'Quality', main = 'Red Wine Quality to Free Sulfur')

plot(whiteWine$free.sulfur.dioxide, whiteWine$quality, col = 'Blue', pch = 19, cex = .5, xlab = 'Free Sulfur', ylab = 'Quality', main = 'White Wine Quality to Free Sulfur')
```

As we can see by the many graphs above, there are a few prevalent patterns. Specifically, in the Total Sulfur graphs, we can see that there are distinct differences between each graph leading to the conclusion that Total Sulfur is playing some role in the quality of the wine. Further differences also appear when looking at the type of wine. Additionally, when discussing Free Sulfur we can see that there is very little variation even between varieties of wines. 

```{r}
plot(Wine$total.free, Wine$quality, col = 'Black', pch = 19, cex = .5, xlab = 'Activated Sulfur', ylab = 'Quality', main = 'Activated Sulfur by Wine Quality')

plot(Wine$free.sulfur.dioxide, Wine$quality, col = 'Black', pch = 19, cex = .5, xlab = 'Free Sulfur', ylab = 'Quality', main = 'Free Sulfur by Wine Quality')

plot(Wine$total.sulfur.dioxide, Wine$quality, col = 'Black', pch = 19, cex = .5, xlab = 'Total Sulfur', ylab = 'Quality', main = 'Total Sulfur by Wine Quality')
```

We can see that there are specific concentrations of an allowed variation from the mean in each respective plot that can help identify a better quality wine. 
After extensive analysis there is a clear correlation between the types of sulfate concentrations and the quality of a wine. 

Done.

*Notes: Each of these sulfate scatter plot graphs are relevant to its particular section because it demonstrates distinct differences between wine types which could demonstrate patterns.
